    <h1>My Interests and Hobbies</h1>
    <p>Just a few things!</p>
    <ul>
      <ol>
        <p class="Interests">Internet</p>
        <li>I have been online since 1994. I have spent thousands of hours, since the Summer of 2001, learning the basics of web page design. In fact, my web site was built and maintained exclusively using NotePad, no other web page design software. I did this to learn making web pages with the most fundamental tool. Since its creation, the website has been a big success for students, and parents. The website has grown to over 1000 pages, with over a half million total visitors and I have received and responded to over 2500 emails. I also created the first Marine Park Band website for the Instrumental Music Department.</li>
        <p class="Interests">Music</p>
        <li>I like everything from Christina Aguilera, Benny Goodman, Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown, Metallica, Lynch Mob, Louie Prima, Stevie Ray Vaughan to Led Zeppelin. However, I do prefer Hard Rock and Heavy Metal, especially from the 1980's. I had an album collection (LP's) of over 600 albums and I stopped counting my CD's at 1,000. Keep Rockin!</li>
        <p class="Interests">Numistatics</p>
        <li>The study and collection of coins and currency.I collect coins and currency for both their historical and investment value. The U.S. Mint and Bureau of Engraving and Printing have created many programs to collect coins, currency and learn a lot about American History. Throughout the course of the school year, I try to incorporate many coins from my collection into my lesson plans. This gives my students the opportunity to see first-hand how coins have changed throughout American history.</li>
